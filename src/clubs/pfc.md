Cultivating leadership qualities and the ability to make intelligent choices based on facts. Assisting the guidance counselor in implementing programs and services. Building a deeper sense of service orientation and personality development to enhance students' self-image and self-esteem. Peer facilitators have the responsibility to help new students acclimate to the school environment, use positive peer influence, act as big brothers/sisters, and be good listeners and friends. The club offers an elective transformative program where students can volunteer as peer facilitators, spot co-learners with emotional concerns, facilitate psycho-educational activities, and refer them to the guidance counseling center.
